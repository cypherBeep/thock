## Installation

### Binary

Right now there are only binaries for Ubuntu and macOS under [releases](https://github.com/rmehri01/thock/releases). Unfortunately there is no support for Windows but the Ubuntu binary will still work in [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

To use the binary you will have to put it on your PATH and may have to change permissions using `chmod` or allowing it in system preferences.

### From Source

git clone https://github.com/rmehri01/thock.git

## Credit

The terminal UI is made using the amazing [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/) library and the online functionality was done using [websockets](https://github.com/jaspervdj/websockets). I also took a great amount of inspiration from other great projects such as [hascard](https://github.com/Yvee1/hascard), [monkeytype](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype), and [gotta-go-fast](https://github.com/callum-oakley/gotta-go-fast).
